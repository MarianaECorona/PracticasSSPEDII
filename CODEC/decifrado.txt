New week no sleep no key
I lost em in the street
And no I cant see with out you
Billy and Badu I ll follow you into any room
Cause I cant hear without you
Shit gets weird when you talk about it

Lit in lineb smile for the photo ID
Insideb thats where we can be free
Your highness caught you sippin on lean
Reminds me thats how its supposed to be

Bitch you fell asleep too fast
I want my money back
But I cant deal without you
Stuck behind your beat
I kick my feet up
Youre so mean
But I cant dream without you
Shit gets weird when you talk about it

Youre gonna make my body fry
Ooh baby dont you cry
